#
# According to https://github.com/kward/shunit2/issues/37
#
#   assertTrue does not work with "set -e"
#
# According to the bash man page, when the `-e` option is used on `set`, the
# shell willâ€¦
#
#   Exit immediately if a simple command exits with a non-zero status. The shell
#   does not exit if the command that fails is part of the command list
#   immediately following a while or until keyword, part of the test in an if
#   statement, part of a && or || list, or if the command's return value is
#   being inverted via !. A trap on ERR, if set, is executed before the shell
#   exits.
#
# This test is fully stand-alone so that the full loading and execution of
# shUnit2 can be evaluated under the `-e` option.
#
# Disable source following.
#  shellcheck disable=SC1090,SC1091

# Enable the -e shell option.
set -e

# Load test helpers.
